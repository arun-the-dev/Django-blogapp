# Django Blog App

This is my second Django project, a simple but functional blog application. While the user interface is minimal, the core functionalities are all in place. This project was a chance for me to solidify my understanding of Django's fundamentals.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **Anonymous Viewing**: Anyone can read blog posts without logging in.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users can create posts, leave comments, and like articles.
- **Sample Data Loader**: A custom management command is included to quickly populate the database with fake data for development and testing.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arun-the-dev/Django-blogapp.git
    cd Django-blogapp
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment** and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Load sample data** (optional):

    ```bash
    python manage.py sample_data_loader
    ```

6.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

The app will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Project Design

This project was built with a focus on functionality over architectural patterns. It's a working example of a Django application and a stepping stone to more complex, structured projects.
